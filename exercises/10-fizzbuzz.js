// --- Directions
// Write a program that console logs the numbers
// from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print
// “fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples
// of five print “buzz”. For numbers which are multiples
// of both three and five print “fizzbuzz”.
// --- Example
//   fizzBuzz(5);
//   1
//   2
//   fizz
//   4
//   buzz

//use build in fn methods => for loop with i and check condition with able to divided by 3 & 5

function fizzBuzz(n) {}

fizzBuzz(5);
